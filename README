NewsCache

NewsCache is a free cache server for USENET News. NewsCache acts to
news reading clients like a news server, except that it stores only
those articles that have been requested by at least one client.
NewsCache targets problems of the current News System like network
bandwidth consumption or the IO load caused by news clients.

If NewsCache is used in addition to a news server, it reduces the
client load of the news server. By connecting the clients to NewsCache
instead of to the news server, multiple requests to the same data will
be requested only once from the news server. In a small test at our
university, we got a hit rate of over 30%, although the interests of
the people accessing NewsCache was relatively wide spread.

NewsCache can also replace leaf node news servers, if not all of the
articles are permanently accessed by news clients. NewsCache only
stores those newsgroups and articles being accessed frequently, while
still providing a virtual full feed. This reduces the network
bandwidth between the former news server and the news feed.
Additionally, it reduces the requirements for disk space and CPU
performance. Less CPU performance is sufficient because no local
article numbering has to be performed and a smaller database has to be
searched.

Installation

See INSTALL for details.

The Library Socket++ 1.2 is required by NewsCache. You can install Socket++
as shared or static library. Please see:
http://members.aon.at/hstraub/Socket++/

After successful installation, you have to create your configuration
file ${prefix}/etc/newscache.conf. A sample configuration file is copied
to ${prefix}/etc/newscache.conf-dist.

A SysV init script for RedHat is located in etc/NewsCache.init. Please
tell me if you need a different one for another distribution/system.

Features

Besides caching USENET News, NewsCache provides the following 
additional features.

* Multiplexing between different news servers giving your users 
  the impression of a single news server holding all those 
  newsgroups.

* Provision of local newsgroups.  This is implemented via the
  multiplexing functionality.  Setup your local news server and let
  NewsCache multiplex between the local and your default news server.

* Offline News Reading. Whenever you connect to your internet 
  provider all your spooled postings will  be sent off to your 
  news server and all the groups you wish to read will be 
  transferred to your local cache

* Support to switch only selected hosts into offline mode. Articles
  from those hosts will be fetched via the updatenews program. This can
  be useful, if you want to read news from a news server with a bad
  link and do not want to wait until the active database is
  retrieved.

* Access control. This feature requires that libwrap is
  installed. This is the case on most Linux Systems. For a detailed
  explanation see man hosts_access. Use NewsCache for the daemon
  list. 


Documentation

Documentation for the NewsCache and updatenews commands can be found 
in the doc directory.  Manual pages can be found below man. They
will also be installed in the location specified to configure. 

There will be also a tutorial available from the NewsCache
homepage, which is available at 
http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/NewsCache/.

Bugs

If you encounter a bug in NewsCache, please send a bug report to
newscache@linuxhacker.org. Especially in the case, when a news reader does not
cooperate with NewsCache.  Comments and patches are also accepted. ;)

Other Useful Comments

If you use NewsCache in offline mode, you might want to grab the
newsgroups you wish to read from a place with better and cheaper
internet connectivity.
