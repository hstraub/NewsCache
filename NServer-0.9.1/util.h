 * The pattern-list is a comma separated list of newsgroup-patterns

 * to indicate that the newsgroup must not match a pattern.
 * Eg: comp.*,!comp.os.win* matches all newsgroups starting
 * with comp., except those starting with comp.os.win. This
 * rule is especially designed for our special windows-friends ;)
 *
 * \param pattern The pattern-list.
 * \param group The name of the newsgroup terminated by \\0 or a
 * 	whitespace.
 * \return 
 * 	\li If the newsgroup is matched by a positive pattern, the number of
 * 		matching characters plus one will be returned.
 * 	\li If the newsgroup is matched by a negative pattern (one that
 * 		starts with !), minus the number of characters minus one
 * 		will be returned.
