Release 1.1.92:
* Bugfix Release
  Mike Harding reports a tin hang error, should be fixed with 
  this Release.

Release 1.1.90:
* Completely reworked authentication model: AUTHINFO USER/PASS supports now
	- file (plain or encrypted passwords). configuration option
	  --enable-plainpass (default=no)
	- unix; configuration options:
	  --with-md5 --with-md5auto --with-shadow
	- pam (pluggable authentication modules) confiuration option
	  --with-pam
	- pam+file same as above, but the user permission can be
	  specified in the addiational file
  file and unix authentication methods are also available in earlier
  version, but now all methods are consolidated in a uniform schema.
  All methods understand further group specification and allow 
  additional methods (example: post). Only the commands are
  displayed with the HELP command, for those are the authorization
  is granted.

* authentification errors now handled.
  a client process accepted only three wrong passwords and
  then the client is disconnected. The answer to the client
  is also time delayed. The necessary parameters are now
  fix implemented, but can be configurable in the 
  configuration file.

* extented XDEBUG command
  Now there are two supported commands:
  XDEBUG DUMP AUTHORIZATION
  XDEBUG DUMP CONFIGURATION
  This commands are only available, if the debug option is
  listed in allow parameter.

* a lot of consolidation work is done, to bring the man
  pages, the example configuration file and the source
  code in synchronization. The newscache.conf manpage
  contains only tested and verified parameters (I hope
  so). 

* all programs follows  the  usual GNU command line syntax,
  with long options starting with two dashes (`-').

* all programs options are verified and corrected and(!) a
  description is available in the man pages.
  
* many bugfixes and patches fom Tilman Linneweh (see
  Changelog for details.




Release 1.1.12:

* NewsCacheClean Enhencement: NewsCacheClean missing to purge "outdated"
article files in the spool cache. If the upstream newsserver reduce the
available articles in a newsgroup (ex. from 1-100 to 50-120), then all articles from nr 1-49 and size greater then 15kBytes, are left in the cache (.art* files). Now NewsCacheClean analyzing every Newsgroup DB and mark every outdated .art file in the internal purge table with timestamp 0 and therefore newscacheclean purges all outdated .art files. This new optimized purge method reduce the cache of my NewsCache Application from 4 to 1 GB, means 3 GB outdated articles!

* Catching "caught signal 6" error messages in news.err. This error occours with broken client or upstream server connections

* Require Socket++ 1.12.9

Release 1.1.11:

* doxygen comments in *.h files; configuration available:

* Bugfixes: if configured with --with-syslog=no (see ChangeLog for details)

* Removed: accesslog, cachestat, hoststat, hostlog

* The programs NewsCache and NewsCacheClean are now lowercase

* Bugfix: caught signal 6 (see ChangeLog for details)

* Qualifier -t removed from updatenews and newscacheclean

* A new manual page for newscacheclean 8

See documentation ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/libstdc++/libstdc++-doxygen-3.0.tar.gz 

NewsCache uses now the Socket++ Library Version 1.12. Please install this first. See: http://members.aon.at/Socket++/

Release 1.1.6: ready for RedHat 8.0 (tested with socket++ shared library).
RedHat 8.0 use g++ 3.2!

* New Article Spool Management for offline mode (new classes ArtSpooler,
  ObjLock).

  switch to the old naming standard.
